# Animation-Mod4

## Deli Dumplings

Welcome to my Module4 Animation assignment. 

I made a minimalist dumpling restaurant website. On the site you can chose and place your (imaginary)dumpling order. But the main part is the animation using transform, transition and keyframes. All of the images I designed myself in Figma.

Hope you like it :)
